# FSOS&SOHS

The new version of computation of FSOS and SOHS, which can compute function on every finite abelian group and easy to use.

and it is able to computing SOHS via FSOS on finite abelian groups.

usage:

Compute FSOS of function f:Z_{n_1}*Z_{n_2},...,*Z_{n_k}

Compute the SOHS of function on T^n

Examples:

Compute_M_polynomial.m for computing the SOHS of  Motzkin polynomial

ComputeS_1SOHS.m for Generating a random  SOHS on S^1 and computing it by FSOS

MAX_SATExample.m  for example of MAX-3SAT

sphere_norm_p.m for computing the SOHS of 1-x^10-y^10 {(x,y):x^2+y^2=1} or 1-x^10-y^10-z^10 on {(x,y,z):x^2+y^2+z^1=1}
