# FSOS&SOHS

The new version of computation of FSOS and SOHS, which can compute function on every finite abelian group and easy to use.

and it is able to computing SOHS via FSOS on finite abelian groups.

usage:

Compute FSOS of function f:Z_{n_1}*Z_{n_2},...,*Z_{n_k}

Compute the SOHS of function on T^n
